My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2021 solutions. Written in python with [type annotations](https://sadh.life/post/mypy-guide).

## Running

Find the answers to part1 and part2 of any day of the problem by:

- Replacing `day_XX/input` file contents with your input.
- Running `python day_XX/main.py`. It will output two values, one for each part.

## Testing

Run `pytest day_XX/main.py` to test that file.
